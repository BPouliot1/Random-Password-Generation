# Random-Password-Generation
The Random Password Generator was made to generate random passwords with the allowed criteria of having uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols being used. If the user does not allow the use of one of these catagories then the password generator will create a password based of the users selections.
What was required of the password generator was to generate a password after clicking a button to ensure that button is the start of the process. A series of prompts would then follow asking what variables would be used. The password length was made to be between 8-128 characters or else error messages would pop up. After clicking through the pop up windows asking what variables to use the generated password would appear on screen.
